\section{Overview}
\label{sec:5-Overview}

Perks are special tricks, feats or other particularities that your character
is capable of doing. They can be taken once per character (unless otherwise
noted) and usually come with requirements that must be met, before they may
be bought with \emph{CPP}.

You can buy a perk anytime you like, as long as you meet the requirements.
Some perks are more powerful than others, and you may wish to consult with
your \emph{GM} first before taking perks.

\section{How Perks Work}
\label{sec:5-How-Perks-Work}

The bonuses given by perks stack with other bonuses from your character
(for example skills) but do not stack with other perks. So if one perk gives
you a +2 on small arms when firing a handgun, and another gives a +1 bonus on
small arms regardless of which is used, the +2 and +1 do not stack to +3 when
using hand guns. Some perks deliberately stack with others, but if that is the
case it is noted in the description of the perk.

  \perk{Quick Draw}{10} You can draw a pistol or a knife that is in an
  slot of your vest as a free action in your turn. You can also draw a
  knife or a pistol hidden on your body (but still in a holster) as a
  free action on your turn.

  \perk{Trusty Sidearm}{5} With the \emph{Trusty Sidearm} perk you can
  a +2 on all checks involved with your sidearm (including aiming,
  hiding it etc.).
