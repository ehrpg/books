## Intro

This project contains the LaTeX sources for the Core Rule Handbook. The Core
Rule provides everything necessary for playing the game.

## Requirements

This project requires your favourite LaTeX distribution and the pdflatex
command. You will also need GNU make to be able to build the PDF.

## Generating the PDF

To compile this into a usable PDF use GNU make:

```
$ make
```

This will create the PDF file for the core rule book in ```core/eh_core.pdf```.

## Hacking

Please stick the UNIX line endings, and if possible use hard line breaks at 78
characters. Please follow the already existing guides for labeling chapters,
sections and subsections.
